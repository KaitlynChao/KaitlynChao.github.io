                        <li> This was an introduction course to SQL, but it was very interesting and valuable for its practical applications, and career prospects. It is a crucial skill for anyone working with databases and data-driven decision-making. </li>

                        <li> This class provided an introduction to computer hardware, software, and communication networks. I particularly enjoyed the section on computer hardware as building a solid foundation of knowledge and skills on this topic is applicable in various ways.  </li>

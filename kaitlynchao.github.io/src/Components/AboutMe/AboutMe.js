                <p>
                    During my recent co-op experience, I had the opportunity to work at Sanofi Pasteur, 
                    a biopharmaceutical company. I worked in the R&D department as a digital R&D student and 
                    learned many things. It was an eye-opening experience and extremely knowledgeable, while 
                    being fun. Prior to this job, I was a barista for a bubble tea shop and an online tutor 
                    for elementary students teaching English/math.

                    Since middle school, I’ve been playing competitively on the badminton team, specifically 
                    girl’s doubles. But currently, I’ve taken a step back and just play recreationally at 
                    TMU’s badminton club. Some other sports I’ve done during school are track and field along 
                    with trampoline club.

                    My favourite sport currently is snowboarding, and my goal is to snowboard in multiple 
                    different countries. Initially, I started skiing when I was 4 years old but switched to 
                    snowboarding at 12 years old because it seemed fun. In the last two years, I’ve started 
                    to snowboard outside of Ontario for the first time, partially due to the lack of snow in 
                    recent years. In 2023, I made a trip to Whistler in British Columbia, and then this year, 
                    I went to Banff in Alberta to snowboard at the Big3 Ski Resorts. Some places I would love 
                    to snowboard at are the Alps in France, Niseko in Japan, Laax in Switzerland and much more.

                    Besides sports, I spend my free time playing video games and trading card games (TCG). 
                    Recently I’ve been playing a lot of Teamfight Tactics along with Apex Legends. For trading 
                    card games, I’ve been playing a lot of Pokemon at local tournaments.
